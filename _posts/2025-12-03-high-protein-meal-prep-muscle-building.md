Meal prep is a game-changer for active individuals and athletes. It's all about planning and preparing meals ahead of time so you can focus on your workouts without worrying about what to eat next. This guide focuses on high-protein recipes, perfect for those who are looking to build muscle mass.

These high-protein recipes are not just for muscle building; they're also incredibly tasty and easy to make. They include Greek yogurt bowls, protein-packed burritos, and grilled lean meats paired with complex carbs. Each meal is designed to provide a substantial amount of protein to aid in muscle recovery and growth.

These recipes cover breakfast, lunch, and dinner, offering a balanced diet that ensures you get the nutrients you need throughout the day. The total prep time for these meals is about 2 hours, which can yield servings for an entire week.

## Ingredients & Sourcing

The ingredients you need for these recipes are easily accessible and can be found at your local grocery store. For specialty items like whey protein powder or specific cuts of lean meat, you may want to visit a health food store or a [BUTCHER_LINK].

Storage tips for these ingredients include freezing lean meats if you won't use them immediately and refrigerating other perishable items like Greek yogurt and fresh vegetables. Depending on the number of servings you plan to make, the cost per serving can range from $3 to $8.

## Step-by-Step Prep Instructions

### Sunday Prep Phase

The first phase involves gathering and washing the ingredients. This usually takes about 10 minutes. Next, you'll spend approximately 30 minutes chopping vegetables and pre-processing other ingredients like cooking rice or quinoa.

### Cooking Phase

The cooking phase involves grilling the meats, cooking the burritos, and preparing the Greek yogurt bowls. This phase may take about 60 minutes. It's important to ensure that all meats are cooked thoroughly for food safety. Once the meals are ready, divide them into equal portions using your [MEAL_PREP_CONTAINERS_LINK].

### Cooling & Storage

Allow meals to cool before storing them in the fridge or freezer. Use airtight containers to keep meals fresh. Store meals in the fridge if you plan to consume them within 3-4 days, otherwise, use the freezer.

## Variations & Swaps

For those who prefer plant-based proteins, tofu or tempeh can be used in place of grilled meats. For the Greek yogurt bowls, a plant-based yogurt can be substituted. You can also experiment with different types of carbs like brown rice or couscous.

## Storage & Reheating

Meals stored in the fridge should be consumed within 3-4 days, while frozen meals can last up to a month. For best results, reheat meals in a microwave or on a stovetop. If any meal shows signs of spoilage such as a strange smell or mold, discard it immediately.

## Community Variations

One r/MealPrepSunday member suggested adding a handful of spinach to the Greek yogurt bowl for added nutrients. Another member swapped out the whole wheat tortilla in the burrito for a low-carb, high-fiber wrap.
