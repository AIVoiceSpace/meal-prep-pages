## Recipe Overview

As a gym enthusiast focused on gaining muscle, your diet is as important as your workout routine. This high-protein meal prep guide is designed to help you get the most out of your fitness efforts. The recipes featured here are not only high in protein, but also balanced with complex carbs and healthy fats, fulfilling all your macronutrient needs. 

These meal preps cover all your meals for the day, from protein-loaded breakfasts to lean meat dinners. The best part is, these meals can be prepped in one day, saving you time and ensuring you always have nutritious meals ready. 

## Ingredients & Sourcing

To prepare these muscle-building meals, you'll need a variety of high-protein foods. For breakfast, Greek yogurt, oats, and mixed berries are the main ingredients. For lunch, you'll need ingredients for a protein-packed burrito - whole wheat tortillas, chicken breast, black beans, brown rice, and veggies. Lastly, for dinner, lean meats like turkey or fish, and complex carbs such as sweet potatoes or quinoa will be required.

You can find most of these ingredients at your local grocery store. For specialty items like whole wheat tortillas or quinoa, check out the [HEALTH_FOOD_STORE_LINK].
