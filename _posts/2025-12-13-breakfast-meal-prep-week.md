## Step-by-Step Prep Instructions

### Sunday Prep Phase

**Egg Muffins**
1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a muffin tin or use silicone muffin cups.
2. Whisk the eggs in a bowl. Add in the diced vegetables, cheese, salt, and pepper. Mix until combined.
3. Pour the egg mixture into the muffin cups, filling each about 3/4 full.
4. Bake for 20-25 minutes until the egg muffins are set.

**Overnight Oats**
1. In five individual jars, add a cup of oats, a cup of milk, and a tablespoon of chia seeds.
2. Stir until all the oats are soaked in the milk. Seal the jars and refrigerate overnight.

**Smoothie Packs**
1. In individual freezer bags, add your chosen fruits and greens. 
2. Seal the bags and store in the freezer.

## Variations & Swaps

Feel free to customize these recipes to your liking. For the egg muffins, you can add in different vegetables or even add some diced ham or chicken for extra protein. For the oats, try different flavor combinations like peanut butter and banana or apple cinnamon. The smoothie packs are also versatile - mix and match your favorite fruits and greens.

## Storage & Reheating

The egg muffins and overnight oats can be stored in the fridge for up to a week, while the smoothie packs can be stored in the freezer for up to a month.
