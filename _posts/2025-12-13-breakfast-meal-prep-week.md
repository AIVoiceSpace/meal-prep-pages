## Step-by-Step Prep Instructions

### Sunday Prep Phase

**Egg Muffins:**
1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a muffin tin.
2. Beat the eggs in a large bowl, season with salt and pepper.
3. Add the chopped vegetables and cheese to the eggs, stir well.
4. Pour the egg mixture into the muffin tin, filling each cup about 3/4 full.
5. Bake for 20-25 minutes until the eggs are set.

**Overnight Oats:**
1. In individual jars, add a cup of oats each.
2. Pour a cup of milk or plant-based milk into each jar.
3. Add your preferred sweeteners and toppings.
4. Stir well, cover, and refrigerate overnight. 

**Smoothie Packs:**
1. In individual ziplock bags, add a combination of your preferred fruits and leafy greens.
2. Add a scoop of protein powder, seeds, and sweeteners, if using.
3. Seal the bags and store them in the freezer.

### Cooling & Storage

Let the egg muffins cool before storing them in airtight containers. Your overnight oats are already in their individual containers, ready to grab-and-go in the morning. The smoothie packs will stay in the freezer until you're ready to blend them up!

## Variations & Swaps

Feel free to get creative with your toppings and add-ins based on your preference or dietary needs. For the egg muffins, you can add cooked bacon, ham, or switch the cheese type. In your overnight oats, try different types of milk, sweeteners, and toppings. You can also add cocoa powder for a chocolatey twist! As for the smoothie packs, the combinations are endless. 

## Storage & Reheating

All three breakfast options can be stored in the fridge for up to a week. Egg muffins can be reheated in the microwave for 30-60 seconds, while overnight oats can be eaten cold or warmed up if you prefer. The smoothie packs go straight into the blender from the freezer.

## Community Variations
