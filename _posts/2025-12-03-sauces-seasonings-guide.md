## Introduction

Meal prepping is a fantastic way to plan ahead and eat healthily. However, one common concern is that prepped meals can sometimes be bland or repetitive. This is where sauces and seasonings come in! They can dramatically transform your dishes, keeping your taste buds excited even on day four of your meal plan.

In this guide, we'll explore how to incorporate sauces and seasonings into your meal prep routine. From creating flavorful dressings and marinades to storing them effectively, we've got you covered. 

## The Challenge

Meal preppers often struggle with finding the right balance in flavoring their dishes. Some might be overwhelmed by the wide variety of sauces and seasonings available, while others might be concerned about the extra calories or sodium these can add to their meals.

As one r/MealPrepSunday member noted, "I want to add more flavor to my meals, but I'm worried about using too much salt or adding unnecessary calories with sauces. How can I keep my meals tasty and healthy?" 

Additionally, storing sauces can be tricky. As another member shared, "I've had sauces go bad in the fridge before I could use them all. Any tips for preserving them longer?"

## Sunday Meal Prep Flow

### Planning

1. **Decide on your meals**: Consider what kind of cuisine or flavors you're craving. This will guide your sauce and seasoning choices.
2. **Choose your sauces and seasonings**: Select a variety of options to keep things interesting. For example, for a Mexican-themed week, you might choose salsa, guacamole, and a spicy dry rub.

### Prep

3. **Prepare your sauces and seasonings**: Make sauces and marinades in advance. They often taste better after the flavors have melded together.
4. **Marinate meats**: If using marinades, allow enough time for your proteins to soak up the flavor.

### Cook

5. **Cook your meals**: Add dry seasonings during the cooking process for maximum flavor infusion.

### Store

6. **Store sauces separately**: To prevent your meals from getting soggy, store sauces separately in airtight containers. Use small containers or even ice cube trays for portion control.

## Real-World Scenarios

### The Health Conscious: Low-Sodium, Low-Calorie Flavor

You're watching your sodium and calorie intake but still crave flavorful meals. Opt for low-sodium soy sauce, fresh herbs, and spices. Use lemon juice or vinegar for a tangy kick without extra calories.

### The Spice Lover: A Week of Heat

You love spicy food and want to incorporate that into your meal prep. Try a variety of hot sauces, chili oil, and spicy dry rubs. Remember to store these separately to adjust the heat level for each meal.

### The Global Cuisine Enthusiast: A World of Flavor

You enjoy a wide variety of cuisines. Plan a different cuisine for each day: Italian (marinara sauce, basil pesto), Mexican (salsa, guacamole, taco seasoning), Asian (soy sauce, teriyaki, curry paste), and so on.

## FAQ Section

**Q: How can I store my homemade sauces so they last longer?**

A: Store sauces in airtight containers in the fridge. Acidic sauces (like vinaigrettes) can last up to a month, while cream-based sauces (like alfredo) might only last a week. Freeze sauces in ice cube trays for longer storage.

**Q: Is there a way to make sauces less calorie-dense?**

A: Yes, you can substitute high-calorie ingredients for healthier alternatives. For example, use Greek yogurt instead of mayonnaise or sour cream.

**Q: How can I add flavor without adding salt?**

A: Use fresh herbs, spices, vinegar, or citrus juices. These can enhance the flavor of your meals without the need for extra salt.
