## Introduction

We've all been there: you've meal prepped for the week, but by Wednesday, you're tired of the same old chicken and veggies. The solution? Sauces and seasonings. They can transform your staple foods into a variety of delicious meals, keeping your taste buds excited and your meal prep game strong. 

## The Challenge

Many in the r/MealPrepSunday community struggle with maintaining variety in their meals. As one member noted, "I've mastered cooking chicken, but it's so boring after a few meals." This is where sauces and seasonings shine. They can turn that chicken into a Thai curry, a BBQ feast, or a spicy stir-fry. 

However, not all sauces are created equal. Some are packed with sugars or unhealthy fats. Others are simply expensive. Then there's the matter of time - who has hours to spend making a complex sauce when you're already prepping meals for the week?

## Sunday Meal Prep Flow

Here's a simple workflow to integrate sauces and seasonings into your meal prep:

1. **Plan**: Decide on the types of meals you'd like for the week. Choose a variety of cuisines to keep things exciting. Mexican, Italian, Asian, Indian - the world is your oyster.

2. **Prep**: Gather your ingredients. For sauces and seasonings, this often means a variety of herbs, spices, and base ingredients like tomatoes, soy sauce, or yogurt.

3. **Cook**: Prepare your sauces. Some, like marinades or dressings, can be as simple as mixing ingredients together. Others, like a curry sauce, may require some cooking. Remember to taste as you go!

4. **Store**: Portion out your sauces into individual servings and store them separately from your meals. This allows you to change up the sauce throughout the week. 

Remember to have your tools handy. A good [vegetable chopper](https://amzn.to/4iuj9Hf) and [garlic press](https://amzn.to/441rzjo) can speed up your prep time, and [herb scissors](https://amzn.to/48cYOCM) are a must for fresh herbs.

## Real-World Scenarios

1. **The Busy Professional**: With a basic vinaigrette and a few spices, you can turn a week's worth of chicken and veggies into a variety of salads. Add some Mexican spices to your vinaigrette for a taco salad, or some Italian herbs for a Mediterranean feast.

2. **The Budget-Conscious**: Sauces can make inexpensive ingredients shine. A simple tomato sauce can turn a bag of pasta into a delicious meal. Or, mix up a spicy peanut sauce to give a bag of frozen veggies some Thai flair.

## FAQ

1. **Can I make sauces in advance?** Absolutely! Most sauces can be made ahead of time and stored in the fridge. Some, like marinades, even improve with time.

2. **What's the best way to store sauces?** Store sauces in individual serving containers to avoid contamination.

3. **Can I freeze sauces?** Many sauces freeze well. Cream-based sauces can separate when frozen, so it's best to use them fresh.
