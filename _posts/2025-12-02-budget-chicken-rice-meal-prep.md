## Step-by-Step Prep Instructions

### Sunday Prep Phase

1. Gather all your ingredients and wash the chicken and rice thoroughly.
2. Season the chicken breasts with salt, pepper, and your choice of seasonings.
3. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and bake the chicken for 25-30 minutes, or until fully cooked.

### Cooking Phase

1. While the chicken is baking, cook your rice. Add 2 cups of rice and 4 cups of water to a pot. Bring to a boil then reduce the heat to low, cover, and let it simmer for about 20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and the water is absorbed.
2. Check the chicken for doneness, then let it cool before slicing into portions.

### Cooling & Storage

1. Once the chicken and rice are completely cool, divide them equally into your meal prep containers. You can use [GLASS_CONTAINERS_LINK] for storage.
2. Store your meals in the refrigerator. They should last for up to a week.
