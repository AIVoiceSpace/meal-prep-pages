## Introduction

We've all been there - rushed mornings, skipped lunches, and take-out dinners. The hustle and bustle of daily life can make it hard to prepare and enjoy wholesome meals. That's where meal prep comes in. It's not just a trend, but a lifestyle change that can help you save time, money, and still enjoy healthy meals. This guide will take you through the basics of meal prep, from planning to preparing to storing. 

## The Challenge

Meal prep can feel overwhelming at first. You might be wondering: How much should I cook? When should I cook? How do I store meals? As one r/MealPrepSunday member noted, the challenge is finding the balance between variety, nutrition, and practicality. Another common concern is food safety and how to properly store meals to ensure they stay fresh. Finally, there's the issue of time. How to squeeze in meal prep amidst a busy schedule?

## Sunday Meal Prep Flow

### Planning

Start with a meal plan. Decide on the dishes you want to prepare for the week considering your dietary needs and preferences. Make a shopping list to avoid unnecessary purchases.

### Preparing

Time to cook! Prioritize dishes that take longer to cook. Use efficient tools like slow cookers or [INSTANT_POT_LINK] to save time and effort.

## Real-World Scenarios

### The Busy Professional

Plan on Sunday: prepare 3 types of breakfasts and 2 types of lunches and dinners. This gives variety without overwhelming preparation. 

### The Budget Conscious

Plan for meals that use overlapping ingredients to save money. Aim for $5/meal on a $50 budget.

## FAQ Section

**Can I prep meals more than a week in advance?**

It's best to prepare meals only for the week to ensure freshness and quality. If you need to prep further in advance, consider freezing portions.

**What's the best container type?**

Glass containers are ideal. They're safe, durable, and don't hold onto smells or stains like plastic can.

## Recap & Tips

- Start with a meal plan and a shopping list
- Use efficient cooking tools to save time
- Store meals in single-serving, glass containers
- Balance variety, nutrition, and practicality
- Cool food before refrigerating

Pro Tip: Don't try to do it all at once. Start small, maybe with just lunches, and gradually build up your meal prep routine.
