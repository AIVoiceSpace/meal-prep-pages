## Introduction

Once upon a time, we all faced the dilemma of what to eat after a long, tiring day. Cooking seems like a chore, and ordering takeout isn't always the healthiest (or cheapest) option. That's where meal prep comes in. Not only does it save you time and money, but it also helps you stick to your dietary goals. In this guide, we'll introduce you to the basics of meal prep and share some tips and tricks from our r/MealPrepSunday community.

## The Challenge

Meal prep can seem daunting at first. You might be asking, "What meals should I prepare? How do I store them? How can I ensure ingredients stay fresh?" As one r/MealPrepSunday member noted, "It's overwhelming to plan a week's worth of meals and balance nutritional needs." Others expressed concerns about time management and food waste. We hear you, and we're here to help. In this guide, we'll cover these issues and more.

## Sunday Meal Prep Flow

Meal prep is more than just cooking—it involves planning, prepping, cooking, and storing. Here's a simple Sunday workflow to get you started:

1. **Planning**: Start by planning your meals for the week. Consider your schedule, dietary needs, and preferences. Make a shopping list of all the ingredients you'll need.

2. **Prep**: Once you have all your ingredients, begin prepping. This could involve washing and chopping vegetables, marinating proteins, or pre-cooking certain components. 

3. **Cook**: After prepping, it's time to cook. You could bake, grill, sauté, or use a slow cooker or [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/4pJqWU8) to prepare your meals.

4. **Store**: Finally, store your meals in [GLASS_CONTAINERS_LINK] to keep them fresh. Remember to cool down the meals before refrigerating.

## Real-World Scenarios

Let's look at a couple of real-world scenarios:

1. **The Busy Professional**: With back-to-back meetings and late-night work, cooking is the last thing on your mind. Meal prep can be a lifesaver in this situation. You might prepare a batch of grilled chicken, steamed veggies, and rice on Sunday and have your meals ready for the entire week.

2. **The Health Conscious**: If you're trying to stick to a healthy diet, meal prep can ensure you stay on track. You might prepare mason jar salads, overnight oats, and protein-packed snacks to avoid unhealthy food choices during the week.

## FAQ

1. **Q: Can I prep for more than a week in advance?**
   
   A: It depends on the food. Most meals will keep in the fridge for 3-4 days. If you want to prep for a longer period, consider freezing your meals.

2. **Q: What's the best container type?**

   A: Glass containers are the best. They're non-toxic, dishwasher safe, and great for reheating food. Plus, they're environmentally friendly.

## Recap & Tips

Here are some key takeaways:

- Meal prep involves planning, prepping, cooking, and storing meals.
- Consider your schedule, dietary needs, and preferences when planning meals.
- Use glass containers to store meals.
- You can prep for a week or more, depending on the food.

Lastly, a pro tip from our community: "Start small. You don't need to prep all meals for a week. Start with one or two days and gradually increase." Remember, the goal of meal prep is to make your life easier, not more complicated. Happy prepping!
