## Recipe Overview

Embarking on a ketogenic lifestyle doesn't mean compromising on flavor or variety. These low-carb, high-fat recipes are designed to keep you in ketosis, while providing ample nutrition and taste. The beauty of this type of meal prep is that it's particularly cost-effective, as many keto ingredients like oils, nuts, and proteins can be bought in bulk. This plan will cover all your meals for a week, including breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

The total prep time is around 2 hours, but the resulting meals can serve up to 6 portions, making it well worth the effort.

## Ingredients & Sourcing

Here is a comprehensive list of ingredients you'll need:

- Chicken thighs - 6 pieces
- Avocado - 3 medium-sized
- Olive oil - 1/2 cup
- Cauliflower - 1 large head
- Bacon strips - 12 pieces
- Almonds - 1 cup
- Cheese - 2 cups shredded
- Green vegetables (spinach, kale, or broccoli) - 2 cups
- Butter - 1/2 cup

Most of these ingredients can easily be found at your local supermarket. For harder to find items or bulk purchases, consider checking out `[INTERNATIONAL_MARKET_LINK]` or `[BULK_SPICES_LINK]`.

## Step-by-Step Prep Instructions

### Sunday Prep Phase

Start by gathering all the ingredients and washing them properly. This should take around 10 minutes.

Next, pre-process your ingredients. Chop the vegetables, shred the cheese, and slice the avocados. This step should take about 30 minutes.

### Cooking Phase

Start by seasoning the chicken thighs with salt, pepper, and your choice of herbs. Cook them in olive oil on medium heat for about 15 minutes each side, or until properly cooked. 

While your chicken is cooking, you can start on the cauliflower rice. Grate your cauliflower, then sauté it in butter until it's tender. This should take about 10 minutes.

Next, cook your bacon strips until crispy, which should take about 5-7 minutes. Once done, use the bacon grease to sauté your green vegetables for an extra flavor kick.

### Cooling & Storage

Allow all cooked items to cool to room temperature before storing to avoid condensation. Use airtight containers to store your meals. If you need container recommendations, check out `[GLASS_CONTAINERS_LINK]`. 

## Meal Prep Matrix

| **Day** | **Main** | **Sides** | **Notes** |
|---------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Monday | Chicken, Bacon | Cauliflower Rice, Greens | Reheat or enjoy cold |
| Tuesday | Chicken, Avocado | Cauliflower Rice, Greens | Straight from fridge |
| Wednesday | Chicken, Bacon | Cauliflower Rice, Almonds | Swap sides for variety |

## Variations & Swaps

If you're vegetarian, consider substituting chicken with tofu or tempeh. For pescatarians, grilled salmon would be a great option. 

Cauliflower rice can be swapped with broccoli rice or even a simple salad of leafy greens. Almonds can be replaced by any other type of nut, or even seeds like pumpkin or sunflower. 

## Storage & Reheating

Refrigerate your meals in airtight containers to maintain freshness. If you're going to eat the meal within three days, refrigeration is enough. Any longer, and you should consider freezing the meal.

For reheating, microwave is the most convenient. But if you have a little more time, reheating in a pan or oven can help retain the texture and flavor of the meal.

## Community Variations

One r/MealPrepSunday member swaps bacon for turkey bacon for a leaner protein source. Another adds a dollop of Greek yogurt on top of their chicken for an extra creamy flavor.
