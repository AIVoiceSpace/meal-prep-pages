## Recipe Overview

Embracing a ketogenic lifestyle doesn't mean you have to give up on taste or spend hours in the kitchen every day. With our Keto Meal Prep guide, you'll discover that preparing a week's worth of delicious, low-carb, high-fat meals can be a breeze. This meal prep strategy is designed to help you maintain ketosis, burn fat, and enjoy a variety of meals throughout the week with minimal cooking time. 

Our featured recipes include keto classics like fat bombs, cauliflower rice bowls, and bacon-wrapped proteins, perfect for breakfasts, lunches, dinners, and even snacks. With approximately 2 hours of prep time, you can enjoy 7 days worth of keto-friendly meals. 

## Ingredients & Sourcing

Our keto meal prep recipes focus on high-quality fats, moderate amounts of protein, and minimal carbohydrates. Here are the key ingredients you'll need:

- Avocados
- Nuts (Almonds, Cashews, Walnuts)
- High-quality oils (Olive, Avocado, Coconut)
- Proteins (Chicken, Beef, Bacon)
- Veggies (Cauliflower, Lettuce, Spinach)
- Dairy (Cheese, Heavy Cream)

You can source these ingredients from your local grocery store, or find specialty items at [KETO_GROCERY_LINK]. On average, the cost per serving comes to about $3.

## Step-by-Step Prep Instructions

### Sunday Prep Phase

1. Gather all the ingredients. Rinse vegetables and pat dry.
2. Chop veggies, nuts, and proteins as required.
3. Prepare the cauliflower rice: Pulse cauliflower florets in a food processor until they resemble rice.

### Cooking Phase

1. Cook proteins: Grill chicken and beef, and fry bacon.
2. Prepare the cauliflower rice bowls: Sauté cauliflower rice in olive oil, add grilled proteins, top with avocado slices and cheese.
3. Make the fat bombs: Mix together your choice of nut butter, coconut oil, and sweetener, then freeze until solid.

### Cooling & Storage

Allow cooked items to cool before storing. Use glass containers [GLASS_CONTAINERS_LINK] for storing your meals. These meals can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week.

## Meal Prep Matrix

| **Day** | **Main** | **Sides** | **Notes** |
|---------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Monday | Cauliflower Rice Bowl | Fat Bomb | Reheat and enjoy |
| Tuesday | Bacon-wrapped Chicken | Avocado Salad | Can be eaten cold |
| Wednesday | Beef and Nut Salad | Fat Bomb | Straight from fridge |

## Variations & Swaps

You can experiment with various proteins like fish or turkey. For a vegetarian twist, try tofu or tempeh. If you're not a fan of cauliflower, try broccoli or zucchini noodles. For dairy-free versions, omit cheese and use coconut cream.

## Storage & Reheating

Store meals in the fridge and consume within a week. Most meals can be enjoyed cold or reheated in a microwave or on the stovetop. If a meal seems off, err on the side of caution and discard it.
