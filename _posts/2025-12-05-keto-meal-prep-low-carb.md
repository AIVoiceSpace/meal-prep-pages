## Recipe Overview

Keto meal prep is a game-changer for anyone following a ketogenic lifestyle. This low-carb, high-fat diet has gained popularity for its potential fat-burning benefits, but planning meals can be tricky. With our guide, you'll discover delicious recipes that make meal prep a breeze, keeping you in ketosis and on track with your health goals. These meals are perfect for breakfast, lunch, dinner and even snacks throughout the day. With a prep time of less than an hour, you'll have a week's worth of keto-friendly meals at your disposal.

## Ingredients & Sourcing

The ingredients used in this meal prep are common in any keto-friendly kitchen. They include high-quality fats like coconut oil and avocados, low-carb vegetables like lettuce and cauliflower, and protein sources like chicken and bacon. The cost per serving is budget-friendly, making this meal prep not only healthy but economical as well. You can easily find these items at your local grocery store, and many of them are available at [BULK_FOODS_LINK].

## Step-by-Step Prep Instructions

### Sunday Prep Phase

First, gather and wash all your ingredients. This shouldn't take more than 10 minutes. Next, start chopping and pre-processing your vegetables and proteins, which will take about 30 minutes.

### Cooking Phase

Now, it's time to cook. Start by sautéing your proteins, then add your vegetables and cook until tender. Finally, add your fats and seasonings. Remember to portion your meals into suitable containers for easy access throughout the week.

### Cooling & Storage

Once your meals are cooked, allow them to cool before transferring them to [GLASS_CONTAINERS_LINK] for storage. These meals can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week.

## Meal Prep Matrix

| **Day** | **Main** | **Sides** | **Notes** |
|---------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Monday | Chicken | Cauliflower rice, Avocado | Reheat or eat cold |
| Tuesday | Bacon | Lettuce, Avocado | Straight from fridge |
| Wednesday | Chicken | Cauliflower rice, Avocado | Swap sides for variety |

## Variations & Swaps

If you're vegetarian, swap chicken and bacon for tofu or tempeh. Cauliflower rice can be replaced with other low-carb options like zucchini noodles. For additional flavor, feel free to experiment with different herbs and spices.

## Storage & Reheating

Store your meals in the refrigerator and consume them within a week. Reheat on the stovetop or in a microwave, depending on your preference. If a meal smells off or shows signs of spoilage, discard it immediately.
