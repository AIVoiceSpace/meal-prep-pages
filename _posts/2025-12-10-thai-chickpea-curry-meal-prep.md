## Ingredients & Sourcing

Here's what you'll need:

- 2 cans of chickpeas (drained and rinsed)
- 1 large onion (diced)
- 4 cloves of garlic (minced)
- 1 can of coconut milk
- 2 tablespoons of Thai red curry paste
- 2 tablespoons of soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon of brown sugar
- Juice of one lime
- Fresh basil leaves (for garnish)

These ingredients are readily available in most grocery stores. If you're having trouble finding the Thai red curry paste, you can find it at [INTERNATIONAL_MARKET_LINK] or [BULK_SPICES_LINK]. 

## Step-by-Step Prep Instructions

### Sunday Prep Phase

1. Gather all your ingredients and wash your fresh produce.
2. Dice your onion and mince your garlic.

### Cooking Phase

3. In a large pot, sauté the onion and garlic until the onion is translucent.
4. Add the curry paste and stir until the onion and garlic are well coated.
5. Drain and rinse the chickpeas, then add them to the pot.
6. Stir in the coconut milk, soy sauce, and brown sugar.
7. Let the curry simmer for about 15 minutes.
8. After simmering, remove from heat and stir in the lime juice.
9. Portion the curry into six equal servings.

### Cooling & Storage

Allow the curry to cool before transferring it to your storage containers. We recommend using [GLASS_CONTAINERS_LINK] for the best results. Store your prepared curry in the fridge, where it can last for up to a week.

## Variations & Swaps

If you'd like to switch up the protein, tofu or tempeh would work wonderfully in place of chickpeas. For the grains, feel free to swap out rice for other options like quinoa, couscous, or even cauliflower rice for a low-carb alternative.

## Storage & Reheating

To maintain the taste and texture throughout the week, ensure you store the curry in an airtight container and keep it refrigerated. When you're ready to eat, you can reheat the curry in the microwave or on the stovetop.
