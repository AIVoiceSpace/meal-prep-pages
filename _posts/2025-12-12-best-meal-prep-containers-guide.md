## Introduction: Why This Gear Matters

The choice of meal prep containers can make or break your meal prep routine. It's not only about storing your food; it's also about maintaining its freshness, ensuring its safety, and making your meal prep process as seamless as possible. This article will help you make an informed decision between glass and plastic containers, taking into consideration factors such as durability, safety, ease of cleaning, stackability, and cost.

## What to Look For: Selection Criteria

When choosing your meal prep containers, consider factors such as material, durability, cost, and ease of cleaning. Glass containers are known for their durability and safety. They don't absorb food smells or stains, and they're dishwasher safe. However, they can be heavy and prone to breakage. On the other hand, plastic containers are lightweight and less likely to break but might absorb colors and odors over time.
