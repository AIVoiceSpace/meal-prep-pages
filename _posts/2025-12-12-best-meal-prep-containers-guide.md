## Introduction: Why This Container Choice Matters

Choosing the right containers can make all the difference in your meal prep routine. The right choice can mean the difference between a neatly stacked fridge and a chaotic mess of mismatched lids and containers. Not only can the right containers help you stay organized, but they can also keep your meals fresh and tasty, ensuring your hard work doesn't go to waste. In this guide, we’ll compare the two most popular types of meal prep containers - glass and plastic - and help you decide which one is right for you. We’ll also consider factors such as budget, durability, and overall convenience.

## What to Look For: Selection Criteria

When selecting meal prep containers, you should consider the material, durability, cost, and ease of cleaning. Glass containers are more durable and often dishwasher safe, but they can be heavy and more expensive. Plastic containers are lightweight and inexpensive, but they may not last as long. You'll also want to consider the environmental impact and BPA content of the containers. Lastly, consider the brand and quality to ensure you're getting the best value for your money.

For plastic containers, hand-washing is recommended to prevent warping. Storing the containers properly can also help prolong their life. Replace your containers when they start to crack or warp, or if the lids no longer fit properly.

## Community Recommendations

Many members of r/MealPrepSunday recommend glass containers because they're durable and easy to clean. However, if you're just starting out or on a tight budget, plastic containers can be a great choice. They're lightweight, affordable, and stackable, making them easy to store.
