## Introduction: Why Good Storage Matters

The right storage container can transform your meal prep experience. It's not just about keeping food fresh, but also about organizing your fridge, transporting meals, and even serving sizes. This guide explores what makes a good meal prep container and dives into the best options available for every budget and lifestyle.

## What to Look For: Selection Criteria

When choosing a meal prep container, consider the material, size, compartments, and lid type. Glass containers are durable and microwave-safe but can be heavy. Plastic containers are lightweight and affordable, but check for BPA-free versions. Consider containers with dividers for portion control, and ensure the lids are airtight for freshness.
